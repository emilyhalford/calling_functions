This repo contains code associated with my 09.26.2020 Towards Data Science article (https://medium.com/@emilyahalford/5-minute-guide-to-calling-functions-from-r-scripts-41c4a09db1eb) which provides a guide for using functions stored in R scripts in R Markdown files.

Three functions are stored in the "functions" script, and these functions are applied in a simple analysis of Google search volume in the "google_trends_analysis" Markdown file.
